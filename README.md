# SharpJelly

SharpJelly is designed to be a simple, easy to use, and easy to extend c# api wrapper for the Jellyfin media server.
The wrapper is designed around dotnet 6 to allow for cross platform development and the ability to package and deploy the wrapper to any platform your codebase may require.


## Documentation
Documentation is not available at this time, although I plan to release proper documentation for the wrapper once the base functionality has been implemented and is stable.
